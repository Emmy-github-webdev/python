# Installing Python and PyCharm on Windows

To install Python, download Python 3.6 (or higher) from **http://www.python.org**.

<br>

Once Python is installed, you can execute the program **cmd.exe**. This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word **py**  and that will start the Python program.

<br>

At all points during the course, you can always type **python3.6 name_of_file.py**  and that will execute the code of a file called **name_of_file.py**.

<br>

To install PyCharm, just download the Community Edition (which is free) from **https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/.**
